<h1> Development Log: </h1>

Started working on the program. I was successful in getting a frog sprite in the up, down, left, and right directions to be displayed upon pressing the arrow keys.
Currently working on the movement of the frog and the edge cases (such as the boundaries of the screen). Left and the Top Screen appear to be working but the right side and bottom edge are troublesome.

Debugging by using ofDrawLine() and ofPolyLine() will try to update with <i> Google C++ styling guide </i> if enough time remains. Writeup concluded for now.
