# CS 126 FinalProject

<h1> Chicken Crossing </h1>

Hello,


Here are the instructions to my game:

Arrow Keys are for movement. 
Up Arrow - Up
Left Arrow - Left
Right Arrow - Right
Down Arrow - Down

ESCAPE - Toggle FullScreen

SPACEBAR = Used to start a new game when game is over

RETURN/ENTER = Used to exit the game while playing it.


To build this file for now.

<h1> Visual Studio 2017 </h1>
<b> Warning: Windows only for now (Stable) </b>
<b> Mac / Linux / Other users: You could probably recompile the files on your prospective platforms :D </b>

Clone my project somewhere into your desktop.

Open Visual Studio and open the solution called "final-project-XXXX.sln" inside of my project.

Then you can click "Local Windows Debugger" to play my game!

Enjoy!
