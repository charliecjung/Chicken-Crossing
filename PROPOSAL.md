#               Frogger 
## I will be using openFrameworks to create a **Frogger** game.

[OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org) will be where I get a lot of the sprites for 
the video game. Audio will be provided by [Freesound](https://freesound.org)
From a high level, I plan to implement a class that will control the game
clock that will update the game at a specific millisecond interval **(100)**.
After every ~100 milliseconds (or constant time) the cars will move across 
the screen. Hopefully, I will be able to use third-party libraries to 
detect hit detection and be able to use the graphics library to display
high scores, the pause menu, and death screen.

This project will probably have *several* abstract classes such as a dedicated
Player class, Obstacle class that will be extended to Cars. Other libaries
will probably be added but I will have to see how they come together throughout
the course of this project.
